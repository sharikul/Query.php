{"name":"Query.php","tagline":"PHP based database interaction class. ","body":"# What is Query.php?\r\nQuery.php is a new PHP based class that allows developers to interact with an SQL based database in an easy-to-write-and-understand format. All related methods are stored in the `Query` class. \r\n\r\n# System requirements\r\nTo ensure that Query.php works well, ensure that the following requirements are met.\r\n\r\n* PHP **5.1.0** for general usage, or version **5.3.0** for custom query building is running,\r\n* MySQL or SQLite Database is the database to connect with,\r\n* PDO Module is installed in the copy of PHP that's running on the server. \r\n\r\n# How to get started\r\nFirst and foremost, it is vital that you get Query.php connected to the database before executing anything. You can do this via the internal `::setup` method, like so:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nQuery::setup( array(\r\n\t'host' => 'localhost',\r\n\t'username' => 'root',\r\n\t'password' => '',\r\n\t'database' => 'blog',\r\n\t'driver' => 'mysql'\r\n));\r\n```\r\n\r\n`::setup`'s API representation:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nstatic function setup( array $options);\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Continue learning\r\nThe included `/help` directory contains a variety of `.md` files about different topics, such as making queries, using internal getters, and creating custom formatted queries. Whenever the specification is updated, `/help` will also be updated with the relevant resources.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
